##### Downloading Julia
Julia is available to download at https://julialang.org/downloads/. This
coding library is compatible with Julia v1.7.1. We expect it is compatible
with later versions as well, just the Project.toml and Manifest.toml files
may need to updated with the newer versions of Julia.

##### Installing the environment
The collection of packages needed to run the statistical analysis of the
paper are defined in the Manifest.toml and Project.toml files. To install
the environment simply navigate to this directory in the Julia REPL. Then
switch to the Package mode by hitting ']'. Next type 'activate ./' and hit
enter. Then type 'instantiate' and hit enter. The packages will download
and install automatically. If there are any compilation issues, we recommend
next typing 'update' and hitting enter.

##### Installing Jupyter
To run the notebooks, you will also need a working version of Jupyter. One
option is to download Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/) and use the 
anaconda navigator to open Jupyter through a GUI. This is a particularly
simple option for Windows users.

A second possibility is to install Jupyter through your local python 
installation in a terminal. This can be a simple choice for Linux users.
For example, type 'python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade'. Then type 'pip3 install
jupyter'. Then type 'jupyter notebook' to launch Jupyter.

##### Performing Ca2+ dependent statistical analysis of inner-ear cadherin
states
The notebook 'Ca2+ Site Probabilities.ipynb' performs statistical analysis
for the Ca2+-configurations at a linker as a function of Ca2+ concentration.
The section *Inputs to be specified by user* has all the free parameters
that a user is expected to change to analyze difference scenarios. 

After those parameter values are defined, a user need only call the 'Run All'
command from the 'Cell' dropdown menu. The notebook will generate figures,
saving them to disk, and will also generate a csv file gibbssmp.csv which
stores the probabilities for all the Ca2+ configurations.

##### Performing statistical analysis for Force Peak Ruptures
The notebook 'Force Peak Rupture' performs the Monte Carlo analysis of 
rupture force distributions calibrated to the force peaks observed in SMD
simulation and the MCMC samples of Ca2+ configuration probabilities. Once
again, the section *Inputs to be specified by user* shows the free parameters
a user is expected to change to analyze different scenarios.

To run, this notebook does need for gibbssmp.csv to have already been
generated by 'Ca2+ Site Probabilities.ipynb' and in this folder. It also
needs the csv file 'Force peaks grouped by rupture.csv' which was included
in the github repository. This latter csv just records the different rupture 
forces that were observed in SMD simulations.
